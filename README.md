# Third Thumb Project
 A low cost solution to the third thumb project. Uses easilly sourced 3D printed materials, electronics modules, and everyday items such as a singular rubber band or some small tubing.

This includes all of the SolidWorks Pack and Go files in order to remix the origional creation. Also provided is are the STLs of each model incase the user does not have a licence for SolidWorks.

If you have a lisence for SolidWorks, please see the 'fingerPREVIEW.zip' file as it may help you when putting together the finger.

Background:

The inspiration for the creation of the Third Thumb came from a collaborative research project between The Plasticity Lab, University College London & Cambridge University within an article titled How Do Our Brains Adapt to Control an Extra Body Part.

The fact that the inspiration behind this project was privately owned afforded me the opportunity to create a Third thumb of similar function, but also make its design sharable to many other interested people through Open Sourcing the project.


Abstract:

This project looked to design a thumb-like appendage that can be controlled using electrical impulses from brain - nerve stimulation and is detected by electrocardiogram (ECG) feedback. The prosthetic “Third Thumb” can then be utilized by the wearer and the wearer’s neuropathways monitored as the brain “accepts” the new thumb and automatically begins to use it. The project's customized components were designed, crafted, and constructed entirely from basic and accessible materials.



What is Open Source?

Open Source is defined as projects that are made freely available for possible modification and redistribution (usually limited redistribution). Products include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product. The Open Source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages the open collaboration from anyone that is willing to support the project. Some actions that one may support the project by doing are actions such as: improvement of existing features, the addition of new features, or bug fixes.


Goals:

To design a prototype prosthetic thumb from basic and accessible materials.
To create a tool for further studying the brain’s capacity to accommodate new appendages.
To afford the public domain the opportunity to adapt this model for use in projects that positively impact prosthetic / biomechanical engineering.




Special Design Considerations:

Prosthetic planes of motion - 2 axis (Abduction / Adduction, Flex / Extend) + quasi opposition rotation
Prosthetic “muscle” lines - designing appropriate leverage points for proper appendage motion using fishing line for muscles / tendons.
Wiring electrical components
Synchronizing electrical, mechanical, and bio-interfacing components.

Approximate Design and Construction Costs:

3D Printer Filament							                     $22
Isopropyl Alcohol							                       $1
WD-40									                                 $5

Impact:

This project helps to expand the availability of prosthetic technology to reach a greater audience of both prosthetic developers and non-developers. These individuals themselves can then help to further scientific fields and industry having to do with Biomechanical engineering, Medical engineering, and Robotics. With this kind of support, this could help provide a future to individuals where prosthetics that are required for the modern way of life can be purchased, upgraded, and replaced for a fraction of the price of present day variants.


Limitations:

The Raspberry Pi Pico fried itself - Lack of reverse voltage diode protecting Pi Pico voltage regulator from servos.
The unit is heavy (245 grams)
The portion of the unit that sits on the upper arm is bulky (83.5mm x 67.5mm wall to wall, and 120.5mm x 67.5mm total).
The product may not be applicable for all audience use. Factors that may prohibit the operation of this technology are impairments having to do with neuropathies or paralysis; upper extremity loss; the use of clothing or protection that obstructs the sensor to body connection or the control unit to thumb connection.
Future Design Improvements:

Decrease Weight and Size
Use slightly smaller servos
Use manufactured PCB instead of Proto-board
Use smaller microcontroller
Increase Reliability
Decrease heat generation
Separate power supply for each type of component
Use PTFE tubing instead of vinyl
Use stronger / more resilient fishing wire
EMG instead of ECG
Debug, fix, and update project motherboard
